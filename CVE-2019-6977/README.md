I discovered this CVE while researching
methods to hide a PHP payload in a file
that will be parsed by ImageMagick while
writing an exploit for CVE-2019-8943.

This PoC exploit overwrites the `autoload_func` function pointer. This
function pointer is executed when a class
that is currently not in scope is instantiated. This function receives only
one argument, which is the name of the
class to be instantiated. It is overwritten with the address to
 `zif_passthru`, the backing C function of PHP's `passthru()`, which also only
 takes one argument, which is a system command, executes it and outputs it.

 By overwriting this function, an arbitrary binary in the current PATH can be executed by calling for example

 ```PHP
new ls();
 ```
